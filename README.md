QA Testing Course 1 - Project Requirements

To run the project do the following: Clone github.com/deartc/Quality-Project-Teresa-Hawkins.  The following Microsoft Offic# Code-Louisville-Quality-Project-Teresa-Hawkins
e Suite programs were used:  Word,  Sway, Vizio, and Power Bi.

Purpose: 
Verizon churn rate is one of the lowest in their market segment.  One of the main reasons is their websites try to engage their customers. This project examines the website  to see if it appeals to seniors or has flaws that might make this sector less likely to not renew their service.   A website  test plan is executed and uses Sway.   A Sway presention  also details a Power Bi visual analysis of churn rates and examines  the quality assurance of the website in relation to churn rate retention.

I used power bi to visually display the Verizon churn  rate and how focusing on this Verizon webpage test might affect this churn rate.  The power bi link is :

#3: Unit Test Creation:
1. On the Vehicle class, add unit tests  and refactor where necessary.
2. On the SemiTruck class, I will implement all methods and write unit tests 
3. Add 3rd class, Car, implement it, and add unit tests for it. the first steps of the code are included here: https://github.com/deartc/CarSection.git
